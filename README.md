## To do:
- Client count per ip address checker (could count ClientSessions per ip address)
- Max request count in a timeframe and cool down period (ddos safety)
- Log levels info/warning/error to enable accurate reporting

## UPLOAD ISSUES:
* Faulty behaviour:
 * Works without a file
 * Works with empty string
 * Dup file names?
* Refine:
 * DELETE to work only in the allowed folder
