# WEBSERV

## AGENDA:

* Error Management:
 * Which file returns what (which are relevant to what client receives)

* Error Pages & Log Levels:
 * Info/Warning/Error levels
 * Custom error pages? (& defaults)


* Location Vars:
 * Take location info from HttpRequest

* mDELETE:
 * DELETE to work only in the allowed folder
 * Delete button in listing.html doesn't work (Methods.cpp)

## FIXED:
* Dup file names: Adds  "new_" infront of the filename if a file with the same name exists | OK!
* Unified Error pages (.html) with corrected error messages. | OK!
* Location info for methods from HttpRequest | OK!
