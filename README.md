# WEBSERV

## To do:
- Client count per ip address checker (could count ClientSessions per ip address) | OK!
- Max request count in a timeframe and cool down period (ddos safety) | OK!
- Log levels info/warning/error to enable accurate reporting

## AGENDA:
* Faulty behaviour:
 * Works without a file
 * Works with empty string
 * Dup file names?
* Refine:
 * DELETE to work only in the allowed folder
 * Error reporting: add INFO & WARNING log levels
* mDELETE:
 * Add to take location from HttpRequest
 * Delete button in folder.html (Methods.cpp)
